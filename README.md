The ASCI dataset has been uploaded to this repository with the permission of the Statistical Office of Bank of Italy. I am extremely thankful to its staff and, especially, Dr. Paolo Piselli for their assistance. The dataset posted in the Data folder is a heavily reduced version of the full ASCI dataset. Complete data are available behind request to the Statistical Office of Bank of Italy. Geographical data are from Istat yearly reports.
